          <strong>1. Introduction</strong><br />
          Welcome to TuneFloww. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of our website, 
          mobile application, and any other online services we provide (collectively, the “Services”). 
          By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as all 
          applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with any of these Terms, you must 
          discontinue using the Services immediately.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes 
          by posting a notice on our website or sending you an email. Your continued use of the 
          Services after such changes are posted will constitute your agreement to the modified 
          Terms. We encourage you to periodically review these Terms to stay informed about our 
          practices.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          TuneFloww is committed to facilitating a safe and enjoyable environment for all users. 
          The Services are designed to allow artists, labels, and creators to distribute music to 
          various digital platforms. We handle the administrative aspects of distribution so that 
          you can focus on your craft. However, to maintain this environment, we require that you 
          adhere to the obligations and responsibilities outlined in these Terms. Failure to do so 
          may result in suspension or termination of your account, as well as any other remedies 
          available to us under law.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>2. Eligibility and Account Registration</strong><br />
          You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to create 
          an account or otherwise use the Services. By creating an account, you represent and 
          warrant that all information you provide is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. You are 
          responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all 
          activities that occur under your account. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your 
          account, you must notify us immediately.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          You may not share your account credentials with anyone else, and you may not transfer 
          your account to another person without our written permission. We reserve the right to 
          suspend or terminate your account if any information provided during the registration 
          process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current, or incomplete. We also 
          reserve the right to refuse registration or cancel an account at our discretion.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>3. License and Intellectual Property</strong><br />
          Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, 
          non-transferable, and revocable license to access and use the Services. This license is 
          provided solely for your personal, non-commercial use (unless otherwise agreed upon in a 
          separate contract). You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our 
          Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the 
          source code of that software, unless such restrictions are prohibited by law.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          All trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features 
          of the TuneFloww brand (“Brand Features”) are the sole property of TuneFloww or its 
          licensors. The Terms do not grant you any rights to use any Brand Features for any 
          purpose, whether for commercial or non-commercial use. Any unauthorized use of the Brand 
          Features is strictly prohibited.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>4. User Content and Conduct</strong><br />
          You retain all rights to the music, audio recordings, text, images, and other materials 
          you upload or distribute through the Services (“User Content”). By uploading or 
          distributing User Content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, 
          sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, display, and 
          distribute your User Content in connection with the operation of the Services. You 
          represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to grant this license and that 
          your User Content does not infringe any third-party rights or violate any laws.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          You agree not to upload or distribute any User Content that is unlawful, harmful, 
          defamatory, obscene, infringing, or otherwise objectionable. You also agree not to use 
          the Services in a way that disrupts or damages the Services or servers, or that harms 
          other users. TuneFloww reserves the right, but not the obligation, to monitor or remove 
          User Content that we deem to violate these Terms, in our sole discretion.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>5. Distribution to Third-Party Platforms</strong><br />
          Our core function is to distribute your User Content (music, metadata, album art, etc.) 
          to various streaming and download platforms (“Third-Party Platforms”). While we strive 
          to ensure a smooth distribution process, we do not guarantee acceptance or timely 
          availability on any particular Third-Party Platform. Each platform may have its own 
          content guidelines, review processes, and timelines that are beyond our control.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          By using the Services, you acknowledge that certain Third-Party Platforms may reject or 
          remove your User Content for any reason, including but not limited to alleged 
          infringement, explicit content, or violation of the platform’s terms. TuneFloww is not 
          responsible for the policies or actions of any Third-Party Platform, and any disputes 
          related to rejections or takedowns should be addressed directly with the platform in 
          question.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>6. Royalties and Earnings</strong><br />
          When your User Content is streamed or purchased on Third-Party Platforms, you may earn 
          royalties or other forms of revenue (“Earnings”). The amount of Earnings you receive 
          will depend on the terms and rates set by the Third-Party Platforms. TuneFloww will 
          collect these Earnings on your behalf and disburse them to you according to the payment 
          schedule outlined on our website or in your account dashboard. We reserve the right to 
          withhold a portion of Earnings to cover any applicable fees, taxes, or other charges.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          You are responsible for providing accurate payment information and for any fees charged 
          by your bank or payment processor. If we are unable to disburse Earnings due to 
          incomplete or incorrect information, we may hold the funds until the issue is resolved. 
          If your account is terminated for breach of these Terms, you may forfeit any unpaid 
          Earnings, subject to applicable law.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>7. Payment Disputes and Chargebacks</strong><br />
          If you believe there is a discrepancy in your Earnings, you must notify us in writing 
          within thirty (30) days of the date the disputed amount was posted to your account. 
          Failure to do so will result in a waiver of any claim relating to the disputed amount. 
          We will investigate your claim in good faith and provide you with a determination. Our 
          decision will be final and binding.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the event a Third-Party Platform issues a chargeback or adjustment related to your 
          User Content, we reserve the right to deduct the corresponding amount from your future 
          Earnings. If your Earnings are insufficient to cover the chargeback or adjustment, you 
          agree to promptly reimburse TuneFloww upon request.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>8. Taxes</strong><br />
          You are responsible for determining and paying any taxes applicable to the Earnings you 
          receive from TuneFloww. We may be required by law to withhold certain amounts from your 
          Earnings, such as withholding taxes. In such cases, we will remit the withheld amounts 
          to the appropriate taxing authority and provide you with documentation if required by 
          law. We are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transactions or 
          for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising from your use of the Services.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>9. Termination</strong><br />
          You may terminate your account at any time by following the instructions on our website 
          or contacting customer support. We may suspend or terminate your account if we believe 
          you have violated these Terms or any other policy referenced herein. Upon termination, 
          you must cease using the Services, and any licenses granted to you will terminate 
          immediately.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at 
          any time, with or without notice. We will not be liable to you or any third party for 
          any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services. If your account is 
          terminated, certain provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive will 
          remain in effect (e.g., license grants, disclaimers, limitation of liability, etc.).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>10. Disclaimers</strong><br />
          THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TUNEFLOWW MAKES NO WARRANTIES, 
          EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS 
          FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL 
          BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR COMPLETELY SECURE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE 
          RISKS INHERENT IN INTERNET CONNECTIVITY THAT COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR USER 
          CONTENT OR EARNINGS, AND YOU AGREE THAT TUNEFLOWW IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SUCH LOSS.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We do not guarantee the availability or uptime of the Services. We may conduct 
          maintenance or updates at any time, and we are not liable for any resulting downtime. 
          You are responsible for backing up your User Content and for ensuring the security of 
          your account credentials.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>11. Limitation of Liability</strong><br />
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL TUNEFLOWW, ITS AFFILIATES, 
          OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
          SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF 
          PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE 
          SERVICES OR THESE TERMS. IN NO EVENT SHALL TUNEFLOWW’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE 
          AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID OR PAYABLE TO YOU IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT 
          GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental 
          or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. In 
          such jurisdictions, TuneFloww’s liability will be limited to the greatest extent 
          permitted by law.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>12. Indemnification</strong><br />
          You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TuneFloww, its affiliates, officers, 
          directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, 
          damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising 
          out of or in any way connected with (a) your access to or use of the Services, (b) your 
          User Content, (c) your violation of these Terms, or (d) your infringement of any 
          intellectual property or other rights of any person or entity.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control 
          of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you agree to cooperate 
          with our defense of such claims.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</strong><br />
          These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your 
          Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising 
          out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be resolved exclusively in the 
          state or federal courts located in [Your Jurisdiction], and you hereby consent to the 
          personal jurisdiction of such courts.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision 
          shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of 
          these Terms shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term or condition 
          shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other 
          term or condition.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>14. Force Majeure</strong><br />
          Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance under these Terms 
          to the extent said failures or delays are proximately caused by causes beyond that 
          party’s reasonable control and occurring without its fault or negligence, including, 
          without limitation, acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, terrorism, 
          epidemics, fire, communication line failures, power outages, or governmental
