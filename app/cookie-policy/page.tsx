          Welcome to TuneFloww (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We use cookies and similar 
          tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to provide, customize, 
          and improve our services. This Cookie Policy explains what Cookies are, 
          how and why we use them, and what choices you have regarding their use. 
          By using our website, mobile application, or any related services 
          (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to our use of Cookies as 
          described in this policy, unless you opt out using the mechanisms 
          described below.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We understand that Cookies can raise questions about privacy and data 
          security. Therefore, we are committed to transparently explaining our 
          practices so you can make informed decisions about how your personal 
          information is used. If you have any questions about this Cookie 
          Policy or our data practices, please contact us at{" "}

          <strong>2. What Are Cookies?</strong><br />
          Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer, 
          smartphone, or other device when you visit a website. They are widely 
          used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide 
          reporting information to the website operators. Cookies can be “first 
          party,” meaning they are set by the website you are visiting, or “third 
          party,” meaning they are set by a domain different from the one you are 
          visiting. Cookies can also be classified by duration: “session Cookies” 
          are deleted when you close your browser, while “persistent Cookies” 
          remain on your device until they expire or you delete them.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In addition to traditional Cookies, we may use other technologies such 
          as pixel tags (also known as web beacons or clear GIFs), local storage, 
          and device identifiers. These technologies can collect similar 
          information about your browsing behavior and are often used in 
          conjunction with Cookies to enable certain features or understand user 
          activity on the Services.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>3. Types of Cookies We Use</strong><br />
          We categorize the Cookies we use into the following types:
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>a. Strictly Necessary Cookies</em><br />
          These Cookies are essential for the Services to function properly. They 
          enable you to navigate our website and use its features, such as 
          accessing secure areas or storing items in a shopping cart. Without 
          these Cookies, some parts of our Services may not work as intended. 
          Because these Cookies are strictly necessary, we do not provide an 
          option to disable them. However, you can set your browser to block or 
          alert you about these Cookies, but some parts of the site may not 
          function.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>b. Performance Cookies</em><br />
          Performance Cookies collect information about how you use our Services, 
          such as which pages you visit most often and if you encounter any 
          errors. These Cookies help us improve the functionality and usability 
          of our Services by analyzing user activity. The information collected 
          by these Cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous, meaning it 
          does not identify you personally.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>c. Functionality Cookies</em><br />
          Functionality Cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make 
          and provide enhanced features. For example, they can remember your 
          username, language preferences, or the region you are in. They may also 
          be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a 
          video or commenting on a blog. The information collected by these 
          Cookies may be anonymized, and they cannot track your browsing activity 
          on other websites.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>d. Targeting/Advertising Cookies</em><br />
          Targeting/Advertising Cookies are used to deliver content that is more 
          relevant to your interests. They may be set by us or by third-party 
          advertising networks. These Cookies remember that you have visited our 
          website and may be used to show you relevant ads on other sites. They 
          also help limit the number of times you see the same advertisement and 
          measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>4. Why We Use Cookies</strong><br />
          We use Cookies for various reasons, including but not limited to:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-6 text-gray-300">
          <li>
            Ensuring the technical functionality of our Services, such as load 
            balancing, session management, and security features.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remembering your preferences and settings to provide a more 
            personalized experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analyzing user behavior and traffic patterns to improve our Services 
            and develop new features.
          </li>
          <li>
            Delivering relevant advertising and measuring the effectiveness of 
            our ad campaigns.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>5. First-Party vs. Third-Party Cookies</strong><br />
          <em>First-party Cookies</em> are set by us, and they help us recognize 
          you when you return to our website and remember information about your 
          usage. <em>Third-party Cookies</em> are placed by service providers or 
          business partners with our permission. For example, we may use a third-
          party analytics provider like Google Analytics to help us measure 
          traffic and usage trends. We do not control these third-party Cookies, 
          and their use is governed by the privacy policies of the providers 
          placing them.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>6. Duration of Cookies</strong><br />
          <em>Session Cookies</em> last only as long as your session on our 
          website; once you close your browser, they are deleted. <em>Persistent 
          Cookies</em> remain on your device until they expire or you manually 
          delete them. The exact expiration date varies depending on the Cookie 
          and your browser settings. We use both session and persistent Cookies 
          to provide a seamless user experience and to remember your preferences 
          over multiple sessions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>7. How to Control or Delete Cookies</strong><br />
          You have the right to accept or reject Cookies. Most browsers 
          automatically accept Cookies, but you can modify your browser settings 
          to decline Cookies if you prefer. You may also be able to remove Cookies 
          by deleting them from your browser history. However, please note that 
          if you choose to block or delete Cookies, some features of our Services 
          may not function properly, and your overall user experience may be 
          affected.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Each browser has its own cookie management settings. For example:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-6 text-gray-300">
          <li>
            <strong>Google Chrome:</strong> Settings &gt; Privacy and security &gt; Cookies and other site data
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mozilla Firefox:</strong> Options &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Cookies and Site Data
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Safari:</strong> Preferences &gt; Privacy
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Microsoft Edge:</strong> Settings &gt; Cookies and site permissions
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">
          If you want to learn more about Cookies, including how to see what 
          Cookies have been set on your device and how to manage or delete them, 
          visit <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AllAboutCookies.org</a>.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>8. Do Not Track Signals</strong><br />
          Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (DNT) setting that sends a signal 
          to websites you visit indicating that you do not want to be tracked. 
          There is no accepted standard on how websites should respond to DNT 
          signals. As a result, we do not currently respond to DNT signals. If 
          and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will re-
          evaluate how to respond to these signals.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>9. Analytics and Advertising</strong><br />
          We may use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to 
          collect information about how you interact with our Services. These 
          tools use Cookies to gather information such as your IP address, 
          operating system, browser type, and pages visited. We use this 
          information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user 
          movements, and gather demographic information. We do not use analytics 
          tools in any way that identifies you personally.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          For advertising, we may partner with third-party ad networks that use 
          Cookies to deliver ads more relevant to you. These networks may place 
          or recognize a unique Cookie on your browser. They may also use these 
          technologies to collect information about your online activities over 
          time and across different websites to predict your preferences and 
          show you ads based on your interests.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>10. International Users</strong><br />
          If you are accessing our Services from outside of the country in which 
          we operate, please be aware that your information may be transferred 
          to, stored in, and processed by us and our service providers in other 
          countries. The data protection and other laws of these countries might 
          not be as comprehensive as those in your country. We will, however, 
          take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an 
          adequate level of protection.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>11. Children’s Privacy</strong><br />
          Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 (or other 
          age as required by local law), and we do not knowingly collect personal 
          information from children. If you become aware that a child has 
          provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately. 
          If we become aware that a child under the required minimum age has 
          provided us with personal information, we will take steps to remove 
          such information and terminate the child’s account.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>12. Security</strong><br />
          We take reasonable measures to protect your information from 
          unauthorized access or against loss, misuse, or alteration by third 
          parties. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method 
          of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee 
          its absolute security. You are responsible for keeping your account 
          credentials confidential and for controlling access to emails between 
          you and TuneFloww at all times.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>13. Changes to This Cookie Policy</strong><br />
          We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes 
          in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory 
          reasons. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting a 
          notice on our website or sending you an email. Your continued use of 
          the Services after we make changes indicates that you accept those 
          changes.
